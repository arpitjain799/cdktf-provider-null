## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform null Provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 2.0` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by generating the [provider constructs manually](https://cdk.tf/imports).

These are the upstream dependencies:

- [Terraform CDK](https://cdk.tf)
- [Terraform null Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-null)
- [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped. While the Terraform Engine and the Terraform null Provider are relatively stable, the Terraform CDK is in an early stage. Therefore, it's likely that there will be breaking changes.

## Features / Issues / Bugs
